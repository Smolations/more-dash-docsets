more-dash-docsets
=================

A collection of Dash docsets I have generated. I hope you find them useful!

I actually find this kind of methodical programming relaxing, so if you have any requests, feel free to ask. I know that the actual Dash team takes requests but they have a threshold before they will bundle them with the app. I have no such threshold. Anyway, just ask. The worst I can say is no.  =]

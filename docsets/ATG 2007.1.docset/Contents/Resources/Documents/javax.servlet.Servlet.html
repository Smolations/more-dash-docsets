  Interface javax.servlet.Servlet
</h1>
<dl>
  <dt> public interface <b>Servlet</b>
</dl>
This interface is for developing servlets.  A servlet is a body of
 Java code that is loaded into and runs inside a network service,
 such as a web server.  It receives and responds to requests from
 clients.  For example, a client may need information from a
 database; a servlet can be written that receives the request, gets
 and processes the data as needed by the client, and then returns it
 to the client.
 <P>All servlets implement this interface.  Servlet writers typically
 do this by subclassing either GenericServlet, which implements the
 Servlet interface, or by subclassing GenericServlet's descendent,
 HttpServlet.  Developers need to directly implement this interface
 only if their servlets cannot (or choose not to) inherit from
 GenericServlet or HttpServlet.  For example, RMI or CORBA objects
 that act as servlets will directly implement this interface.
 <p>The Servlet interface defines methods to initialize a servlet, to
 receive and respond to client requests, and to destroy a servlet and
 its resources.  These are known as life-cycle methods, and are called
 by the network service in the following manner:
 <ol>
 <li>Servlet is created then <b>init</b>ialized.
 <li>Zero or more <b>service</b> calls from clients are handled
 <li>Servlet is <b>destroy</b>ed then garbage collected and finalized
 </ol>
 Initializing a servlet involves doing any expensive one-time setup,
 such as loading configuration data from files or starting helper
 threads.  Service calls from clients are handled using a request and
 response paradigm.  They rely on the underlying network transport to
 provide quality of service guarantees, such as reordering,
 duplication, message integrity, privacy, etc. Destroying a servlet
 involves undoing any initialization work and synchronizing
 persistent state with the current in-memory state.
 <p>In addition to the life-cycle methods, the Servlet interface
 provides for a method for the servlet to use to get any startup
 information, and a method that allows the servlet to return basic
 information about itself, such as its author, version and copyright.

<dl>
  <dd> Initializes the servlet. The method is called once,
 automatically, by the network service when it loads the servlet.
 It is guaranteed to finish before any service requests are
 accepted.  After initialization, the network service does not
 call the init method again unless it reloads the servlet after
 it has unloaded and destroyed it.
 <p>The init method should save the ServletConfig object so that
 it can be returned by the getServletConfig method.  If a fatal
 initialization error occurs, the init method should throw an
 appropriate "UnavailableException" exception.  It should never
 call the method System.exit.

<dl>
  <dd> Carries out a single request from the client.  The method
 implements a request and response paradigm.  The request object
 contains information about the service request, including
 parameters provided by the client.  The response object is used
 to return information to the client.  The request and response
 objects rely on the underlying network transport for quality of
 service guarantees, such as reordering, duplication, privacy,
 and authentication.
 <p>Service requests are not handled until servlet initialization
 has completed.  Any requests for service that are received
 during initialization block until it is complete.  Note that
 servlets typically run inside multi-threaded servers; servers
 can handle multiple service requests simultaneously.  It is the
 servlet writer's responsibility to synchronize access to any
 shared resources, such as network connections or the servlet's
 class and instance variables.  Information on multi-threaded
 programming in Java can be found in <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/Series/Tutorial/java/threads/multithreaded.html">the
 Java tutorial on multi-threaded programming</a>.

<dl>
  <dd> Cleans up whatever resources are being held (e.g., memory, file
 handles, threads) and makes sure that any persistent state is
 synchronized with the servlet's current in-memory state.  The
 method is called once, automatically, by the network service
 when it unloads the servlet. After destroy is run, it cannot be
 called again until the network service reloads the servlet.
 <p>When the network service removes a servlet, it calls destroy
 after all service calls have been completed, or a
 service-specific number of seconds have passed, whichever comes
 first.  In the case of long-running operations, there could be
 other threads running service requests when destroy is called.
 The servlet writer is responsible for making sure that any
 threads still in the service method complete.

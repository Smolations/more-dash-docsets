      <h1>Long description for punctuation and drop cap example</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates a drop cap layout using 
the :first-letter pseudo-class. However, unlike the previous
diagram, the text begins with punctuation.

<P>There are 5 lines of text. The first line begins with a
large double quote mark (") followed by a
large, italic capital "A" that spans three lines. The rest of the text
flows around the '"A': the first three lines lie to its right
and the last two below it (aligned with the left
side of the double quote mark).

<P>In the following PRE element layout, the space occupied
by the "A" in the second and third lines is represented
by underscores (_):</P>

<PRE>
"   A bird in
   __ the hand
  ___ is worth
two in the bush,"
says an old proverb.

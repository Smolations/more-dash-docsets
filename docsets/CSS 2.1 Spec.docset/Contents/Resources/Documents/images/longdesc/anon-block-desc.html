      <h1>Long description for anonymous block box</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates how anonymous block boxes
     may spring into existence around anonymous content.

<P>
It shows two rectangular boxes that contain text, the first being
anonymous.  It has a light grey background
and contains the words "Some text".  Just below it is a P box with a
dark grey background that contains the words "More text". The boxes
are both within a DIV box.

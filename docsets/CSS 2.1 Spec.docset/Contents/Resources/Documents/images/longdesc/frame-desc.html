      <h1>Long description for frame layout example</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates a frame-like layout with 'position:
fixed'.

<P>The illustration shows a four-panel frameset. The
top panel ("header") covers the entire width of the frameset and 
takes up 15% of the vertical space. Below it on the left
is the "sidebar", which is 10em wide; it's height is automatically
calculated. To the right of the sidebar and below the header
is the "main" area, whose dimensions are computed based on 
remaining available space. Finally, at the bottom, the "footer"
area is 100px high and covers the entire width of the frameset.

<P>Each area is labeled and dimensions that are not 'auto' are
indicated.

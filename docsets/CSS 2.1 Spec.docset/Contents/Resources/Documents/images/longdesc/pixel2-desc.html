      <h1>Long description for the illustration of reference
vs. device pixel</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the relationship between the reference
pixel and device pixels (called "dots" below).


<P>The image depicts a high resolution (large dot density) laser
printer output on the left and a low resolution monitor screen on the
right. For the laser printer, one square reference pixel is
implemented by 16 dots. For the monitor screen, one square reference
pixel is implemented by a single dot.

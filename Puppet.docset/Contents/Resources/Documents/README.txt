This copy of the Puppet Labs documentation comes with its own bare-bones webserver, which
can be used to view and navigate the entire site offline. To use it:

1. Ensure you have the rack gem installed. Run:

    $ sudo gem install rack

2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
3. Run:

    $ rackup

4. In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:9292
5. When finished, you can stop the webserver by returning to the original terminal window and hitting ctrl-C.
